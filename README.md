# Combining HTML and CSS
1. Use link HTML elemet to import the css file to html file
2. Use HTML element attributes to apply css containing styles to HTML content

# NOTE
By using HTML element attributes, we can add aditional information to that same HTML element.
  <br>
like text-alignment, color to text, font to text, font-weight to text, underline to text.....etc.
  <br>
Eevery HTML element will take a rectangular box shape
  <br>
  
# CSS Box Model
  1. Every HTML elemet will take a rectangular box shape,
  2. So each box has following properties.
   <br>
    1. Height
    2. Width
    3. Padding
    4. Border
    5. Margin
   <br>
  
# Intro Bootstrap
It is large collection of code snippets related to html, css and javascript.
  
# Dynamic Web Applications
  Building Dynamic web applications mainly involves:
  1. Client Server Communication
  2. Manipulating HTML and CSS
  3. Writing Application Logic
  <br>
